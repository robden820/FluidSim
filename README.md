# FluidSim

To do:
 - Pressure update results in NaN pressures.
 - Add weights to interpolation to/from grid.
 - Parallel computing.
 - - oneTBB
 - - CUDA: to do.
 - Faster linear algebra -> Eigen?

Long term:
 - Application refactoring
 - - Increase modularity
 - Use templates alongside inheritance for 2D and 3D class variants.
